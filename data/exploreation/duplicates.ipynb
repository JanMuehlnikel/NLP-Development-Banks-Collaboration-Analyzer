       "Project supported by the Funding Programme for Development Education in Germany; The project is aimed at target groups in Germany. Based on the BMZ's concept of \"Development Information and Education\", educational events are held to draw attention to issues relevant to development policy and to impart applicable knowledge. Participants are encouraged to critically examine development policy issues and are enabled to recognise the actions of third parties as well as the consequences of their own actions and to evaluate them in relation to development policy issues. They are encouraged to engage sustainably for a globally just world. The project works with children, adolescents, young adults, teachers or other multipliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  508\n",

       "Project supported by the Funding Programme for Development Education in Germany. Project supported by the Funding Programme for Development Education in Germany  The project is aimed at target groups in Germany. Based on the BMZ's concept of \"Development Information and Education\", educational events are held to draw attention to issues relevant to development policy and to impart applicable knowledge. Participants are encouraged to critically examine development policy issues and are enabled to recognise the actions of third parties as well as the consequences of their own actions and to evaluate them in relation to development policy issues. They are encouraged to engage sustainably for a globally just world. The project works with children, adolescents, young adults, teachers or other multipliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               508\n",
