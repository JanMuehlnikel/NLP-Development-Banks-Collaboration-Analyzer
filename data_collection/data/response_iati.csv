How do we apply Oxfam's resilience definition in urban contexts? How does it look like in urban settings? A number of Oxfam country offices and partners want to engage in a participatory and empowering processes to harvest, co -create, exchange, and use knowledge and embed an appetite for collective learning.

It will engage more staff and partners from other locations who will be invited to join during the process. The rapid urbanization rates and incidence of disasters in many of the regions and countries that we work in is making it imperative for Oxfam to adapt, design and learn about approaches and tools that enable us to be more effective in dealing with urban resilience challenges.  Learning on past and present experiences will help us increase quality of programmes and inspire new countries and teams.

In the coming years, this approach would prove even more relevant, as refugees are increasingly compelled to make radical decisions about their future  - like returning to Syria or moving to ostensibly more welcoming areas in Lebanon – with often little reliable information to guide those choices. Oxfam's interventions thus focus on equipping refugees with key information pertaining to their access to essential services, civil status documentation, and rights and protective laws against exploitation and coercion. Information shared with target population will increase the knowledge on own rights, existing legal requirements and ways to access relevant services and assistance available in a safe manner, increasing capacity to prevent and mitigate protection risks. With this knowledge, individuals are also expected to be able to contact service providers directly, through the support of a focal point, or by contacting Oxfam staff and partners. Refugee women, often more vulnerable to abuse and harassment, face unique threats that Oxfam, through its partnership with specialized local SGBV case management organizations, addresses systematically within its broader response to the needs of the community. Oxfam's protection monitoring findings, as well as feedback communicated to its staff in the field, highlight fears of forced return and eviction as being the most preoccupying for refugees.

Based on this, the action will take a bottom -up approach, which will include the empowerment of community -based women's rights organisations and moving up to engaging national state actors for policy influencing. These approaches will focus on articulating:   • Article 6 and 7: Equality in marriage and divorce, 18 years as the minimum age of marriage, preference for monogamy, and protection of wives' rights in polygamous relationships;  • Article 14: Right to control fertility; protection from HIV/AIDS; and obligation to provide adequate, affordable, and available health services and medical abortion under certain conditions; and  • Article 15, 18 & 21: Women's land rights and the right to equitable inheritance to matrimonial and parental property areas which will lead to informed policy influencing and enhance women rights.
